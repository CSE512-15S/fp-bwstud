##Abstract
In this paper I describe work towards a visualization joining geospatial data from the NHDPlus v2 hydrologic framework, with real-time streamflow values collected by the National Water Information System. GIS software is generally inaccessible to the public due to an expensive, proprietary license model and highly complex operation. Developing an approachable, in-browser experience for exploring this data will benefit water resource engineers in studying and responding to mounting concerns around the availability and quality of water, but also promises application in other fields. I survey existing works which have influenced my own, detail my approach for acquiring and processing data stored by multiple government services and discuss prospects for future work, including scaling these techniques to the national level and relating the visualization to other political, natural and industrial data of interest.
